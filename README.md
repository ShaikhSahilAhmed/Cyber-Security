# Cyber-Security
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a software-related application where we can detect the system or network activities and notice if any suspicious task happens. Excellent broadening and the use of the internet lift examines the communication and save the digital information securely. Now a days, attackers use variety of attacks for fetching private data. Most of the IDS techniques, algorithms, and methods assist to find those various attacks. The central aim of the project is to come up with an overall study about the intrusion detection mechanism, various types of attacks, various tools and techniques, and challenges. We used various machine learning algorithms and found performance metrics like accuracy, recall, F-measure, etc and compared with the existing work. After this research, we got good results that can help to detect the cyber attacks being performed in the network.
