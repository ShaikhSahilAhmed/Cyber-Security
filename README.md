Intrusion Detection System (IDS) defined as a software application which we can trace the network or system activities and find if any malicious activity occurs. Outstanding growth and usage of the internet raises concerns about how to communicate and protect the digital information safely. In todayâ€™s scenario attackers use different types of attacks for fetching the private information. Many of the Intrusion Detection techniques, methods and algorithms help to find those several attacks. The fundamental purpose of this project is to provide an overall study about the intrusion detection mechanism, types of intrusion detec- tion methods, types of attacks, different tools and techniques, research needs and challenges.
